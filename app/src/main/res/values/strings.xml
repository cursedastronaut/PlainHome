        Thanks for downloading Plainhome.\n
        This launcher aims to be very simple, as the colorful icons, the wallpaper,
        and even widgets get us to spend more and more time on our phone, I decided
        to make this to try and help to reduce their impacts.\n\n

        If you want to set this launcher as default launcher, press the button
        under this message. If you change your mind, you can launch your old
        launcher through this one, and it will most likely prompt you to set it
        as default. Have a nice day.
